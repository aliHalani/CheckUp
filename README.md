# Class Connect

CheckUp is a concept for a healthcare management platform that connects doctors and patients so they can manage their appointments and prescriptions, and allows patients to have prescriptions delivered to them when ready.

The front-end is built with React, which retrieves data from an API served by Flask. Application data is stored in a MySQL database.
